                My colleague Lizzy Alspach and I spent months reporting this story as part of a series that dove into a multi-billion dollar state plan to improve Maryland's public schools. I spoke with school district officials, members of the plan's accountability board and educators across the state to learn how the plan's implementation will be monitored. Our story was picked up by multiple state news outlets, such as MoCo360 and The Maryland Daily Record.

              I wrote this story as India's 2023 lunar mission launched and filed it immediately after the live broadcast ended. I also compiled information on previous missions to the moon to provide further context about the historic mission. My story was one of the featured stories of Aviation Week and Space Technology's print magazine and the cover story of the digital version.
